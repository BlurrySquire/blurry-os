- If you want to submit any new features please speak to me first so you don't spend your time implementing the feature for it to get rejected because I don't like it or it doesn't fit the scope of the project. You can reach out by opening an issue.

- Don't use AI. If you're suspected to be using AI and can't explain your code or don't seem to understand it well then it will be rejected under the suspicion of using AI.

- Try and follow a similar coding style to the majority of the codebase. More information will be published on the coding style soon.

- Please add comments to your code in areas where it may not be obvious what is happening. But do not be excessive with the comments.
